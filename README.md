A flower identification model using CNN, TensorFlow, and Keras is built by:

1-Collecting and preprocessing labeled flower images.
2-Creating a CNN model in Keras with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
3-Compiling the model with an optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric.
4-Training the model using the training dataset.
5-Evaluating the model's performance on the test dataset.
6-Using the trained model for flower type prediction.
